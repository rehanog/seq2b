### Phase 3.5: Technical Debt Refactoring âœ… COMPLETED

#### Parser Architecture Refactoring âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Restructure parser files for single responsibility:
  - [x] Create file_parser.go - Contains ParseFile() and ParseDirectory() orchestration
  - [x] Create line_parser.go - Full parsing of line-level features (TODO, tags, etc.)
  - [x] Rename block.go to block_parser.go - Pure structural organization of pre-parsed lines
  - [x] Create markdown_renderer.go - Move RenderToHTML() and formatting functions
- [x] Update parsing flow:
  - [x] Line parser fully parses line-level features in initial pass
  - [x] Line struct carries parsed data (TodoInfo, etc.)
  - [x] Block parser reorganizes pre-parsed lines into hierarchical structure
  - [x] Blocks reference already-parsed data (no re-parsing needed)
- [x] Benefits: Clean separation of concerns, single-pass parsing, better performance

#### Additional Refactoring âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Separate parsing from rendering:
  - [x] Change parser to output structured segments (text, bold, link, etc.) instead of HTML
  - [x] Remove RenderToHTML() from Go parser
  - [x] Move HTML generation to frontend JavaScript
  - [x] Benefits: Clean separation of concerns, flexible rendering, testable parsing
- [x] Implement incremental updates for editing:
  - [x] Return edit deltas from backend (added/removed/updated blocks)
  - [x] Update only affected DOM elements instead of full page reload
  - [x] Handle structural changes (block splits, merges, indentation)
  - [x] Update backlinks incrementally
  - [x] Benefits: Much faster editing, no UI flicker, maintains scroll position

#### Phase 3.5 Goal âœ… ACHIEVED
Clean up technical debt and improve code efficiency before adding new features.

### Phase 4: Daily Driver Features

### Phase 6: Logseq Markdown Compatibility - Safe Import
**Goal**: Import Logseq files without breaking - parse but don't necessarily render all features

#### Key Strategy
- **Parse but don't render** unsupported features initially
- **Preserve original content** even if we can't display it properly
- **Show placeholders** for complex features (e.g., "Query: {{query}}")

- [ ] Parse `((block-id))` as plain text or placeholder
- [ ] Show placeholder: "[Block reference: block-id]"
- [ ] Don't crash on invalid references

#### Step 6.3: Safe Import - Properties & Tags
- [ ] Parse `property:: value` syntax
- [ ] Store properties in block metadata
- [ ] Parse `#tag` syntax without breaking
- [ ] Display tags as plain text initially
- [ ] Handle SCHEDULED: and DEADLINE: dates
- [ ] Parse extended TODO states (NOW, DOING, LATER, etc.)

#### Step 6.4: Safe Import - Complex Features
- [ ] Parse `{{query}}` blocks â†’ show "Query: [query text]"
- [ ] Parse `{{embed}}` blocks â†’ show "Embed: [content]"
- [ ] Parse tables â†’ preserve as code blocks initially
- [ ] Parse `~~strikethrough~~` â†’ show as plain text
- [ ] Parse `==highlight==` â†’ show as plain text
- [ ] Log all unsupported features for user awareness

## Technical Decisions

### Data Model
```go
type Page struct {
    ID        string
    Title     string
    Blocks    []Block
    Backlinks []Reference
    Tags      []string
    Modified  time.Time
}

type Block struct {
    ID         string
    Content    string
    Children   []Block
    Properties map[string]string
    References []Reference
}

type Reference struct {
    FromID string
    ToID   string
    Type   RefType // inline, tag, property
}
```

### Performance Targets
- Parse 10,000 pages < 1 second
- Query response < 10ms
- Memory usage < 500MB for 100k blocks
- Instant sync for changes < 1MB

### Security Requirements
- All binaries signed with developer certificate
- Plugins must be cryptographically verified
- WASM sandbox with restricted capabilities
- No network access without explicit permission

### Native GUI Framework Options

#### Option 1: Wails
- **Pros**: Native look/feel, uses system webview, small binary size
- **Cons**: Still uses web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) for UI
- **Best for**: Rapid development with web skills

#### Option 2: Fyne
- **Pros**: Pure Go, truly native, cross-platform, material design
- **Cons**: Custom look (not system native), larger binaries
- **Best for**: Consistent cross-platform experience

#### Option 3: Gio
- **Pros**: Pure Go, immediate mode, high performance, small
- **Cons**: Lower level, more work for complex UIs
- **Best for**: Maximum performance and control

**Recommendation**: Start with Fyne for faster development, consider Gio later for performance optimization

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each parsing function
- Test files with various markdown edge cases
- Benchmark tests for performance goals
- Integration tests for full pipeline

## Go Testing Conventions
- Test files: `*_test.go` in same package
- Test functions: `TestXxx(t *testing.T)`
- Table-driven tests for multiple cases
- Benchmark functions: `BenchmarkXxx(b *testing.B)`

## Critical Features for Logseq Migration

These are the absolute minimum features required for existing Logseq users to migrate:

1. **Phase 6: Logseq Markdown Compatibility** - Must be able to import existing files without data loss
2. **Phase 7: Persistence & Performance** - Must handle large vaults (10,000+ pages) without stuttering
3. **Local Git Versioning** - Auto-commit changes locally (without sync) for version history
4. **Block collapse/expand** (Phase 5.3) - Core navigation feature users expect

Non-critical but expected:
- Page properties (Phase 5.2) - Nice for organization but not blocking
- PDF annotations (Phase 8.2) - Important for academic users but not universal
