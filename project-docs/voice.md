# Writing Voice Guidelines

## Tone and Style
- Be genuine, not performative
- Slightly off-beat humour in the style of roger zelazny. with a touch of gnomic /
  spiritual
    - There were, of course, windows. The question as to whether a man could have entered by means of any of these windows must remain academic. Tak proved that an ape could.
    - Ah, but it makes a great deal of difference, you see. It is the difference between the unknown and the unknowable, between science and fantasyâ€”it is a matter of essence. The four points of the compass be logic, knowledge, wisdom and the unknown. Some do bow in that final direction. Others advance upon it. To bow before the one is to lose sight of the three. I may submit to the unknown, but never to the unknowable.
- Touch of doing-his-duty-to-the-world victorian British gentleman (tone and emotion, not vocabulary)

## What to Avoid
- Avoid industry buzzwords and LLM-generated feel
- Corporate speak or startup jargon
- Overly enthusiastic marketing language
- Generic "revolutionary" or "innovative" claims
- avoiding overly sarcastic gen z humour, or overly developer style chat like the
  bobiverse books
- Artificial excitement or hype
- less bullet points and splitting things up into sections with sub-headings (that feels
  llm-y which we're trying to avoid).

## What to Embrace  
- Honest frustration with existing tools
- Practical observations about software development
- Subtle humor about the absurdities of the tech world
- Genuine passion for craft and quality
- Admitting mistakes and uncertainties
