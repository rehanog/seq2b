## What seq2b Will and Won't Do

### Our Philosophy: The Best Personal Second Brain

seq2b is laser-focused on being the best personal knowledge management tool. We're not trying to be everything to everyone.

### What We Won't Do

1. **Collaborative Editing**
   - Tools like Google Docs, Notion, and Obsidian Publish already solve real-time collaboration extremely well
   - Adding half-baked collaboration features would dilute our core mission
   - Personal knowledge management has different requirements than team collaboration

2. **Built-in Publishing/Sharing**
   - If you want to share your notes publicly, export them and use existing publishing platforms
   - We focus on private, personal knowledge management

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - No team management, permissions, or admin panels
   - This is a tool for individuals, not organizations

### What We Will Do

1. **Blazing Fast Performance**
   - Handle 10,000+ page vaults without stuttering
   - Instant search and navigation
   - Efficient memory usage

2. **Rock-Solid Reliability**
   - Never lose data
   - Local-first with version control
   - Clear, inspectable file formats

3. **Thoughtful AI Integration**
   - AI as a thinking partner, not a replacement for thinking
   - Privacy-first with local LLM options
   - Semantic search and smart suggestions

4. **Seamless Multi-Device Sync**
   - Your brain on all your devices
   - Conflict-free sync via Git/JJ
   - Offline-first architecture

### The seq2b Difference

We're not competing on feature count. We're competing on:
- Speed and reliability
- Privacy and data ownership  
- Focus on individual knowledge work
- Deep integration with your thinking process

If you need team collaboration, use Notion. If you need to publish a blog, export to Markdown and use Ghost/Hugo/Jekyll. 

seq2b is for capturing, connecting, and developing your personal knowledge graph. That's it. And we're going to be the absolute best at it.
