SIMPLE PARSING TEST FILES
========================

This directory contains simple, focused test files for unit testing the parser.

Each file tests specific parsing features:

- basic-markdown.md      - Basic markdown elements (headers, emphasis, lists)
- markdown-elements.md   - Additional markdown features
- logseq-blocks.md      - Logseq-specific block syntax and indentation
- backlinks-test.md     - Wiki-style [[page links]] and backlink detection
- todo-test.md          - TODO/DONE task parsing

These files are used in parser unit tests and for manual testing during development.
They are intentionally small and focused on specific features.
